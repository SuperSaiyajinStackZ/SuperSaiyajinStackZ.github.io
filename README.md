### NOTE: This site is currently in progress of getting rewritten.

The source code for my GitHub Pages site. This site is based of the [Sim2Team](https://github.com/Sim2Team) sites, where some of the site's "code" was written by me.

You can find the page at [https://supersaiyajinstackz.github.io](https://supersaiyajinstackz.github.io).

## Building

To test the site locally install Jekyll by running:
```
gem install --user-install bundler jekyll
```
Then run
```
bundle install
```
Then you can run the site by running:
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
