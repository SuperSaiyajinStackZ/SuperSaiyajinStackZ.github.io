# Mystery Dice Game Documentation -- Game Logic

## Game Logic.

- Each player starts with 100 Health Power [HP].

- Each turn, a player can buy a Magic Effect [ME] using Magic Power [MP], activate it and roll a dice.

- The dice is the initial amount of damage.

- The current Player can select a Player, which should get the damage.

- Depending on the Magic Effect [ME], it can increase or decrease the amount of damage.

- After all Players have made their turn, each Player will get one Magic Power [MP]. (MagicPower++;)

- If one player has 0 Health Power [HP], the player will lose.

- The goal is, to win against all players, so strategy is also a big thing!!
