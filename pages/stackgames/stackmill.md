	<b>StackMill is a clone of the Mill game for Nintendo 3DS.</b><br>
</p>


This is just a simple `The Mill` game clone i created for Nintendo 3DS, because i haven't found one yet and thought, why not.

The name `StackMill` is basically just a mix from my name `Stack(Z)` and `Mill`, hence -> `StackMill`.

You can read more about that game on the wikipedia page [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_men%27s_morris).


## Features
StackMill includes the following features right now:

* Select a color from 10 for the Stones from Player 1, Player 2 and a highlighted color for possible plays.

* Multi Language support. Currently supporting English, German and Japanese.

* Importing / Exporting the current match's data, so you can save important matches whenever you want and load them whenever you want.

* Play together with a friend on a single console, with a random Computer / AI or with a 50:50 Computer / AI. The random AI is enabled by default, so if you want to play with a friend, disable it in the second tab `Settings` -> `Game Settings`, so that `Computer Opponent` has the Red Stone.
