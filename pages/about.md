## About me
[![StackZ-Avatar-Image](/assets/images/stackz.png){:.img-small}](/assets/images/stackz.png)

Hey, it's me, StackZ or also known as SuperSaiyajinStackZ. I'm the founder of the Universal-Team and that's it.

I work on 3DS, and sometimes NDS homebrew apps, because it is fun to do so in C++. You can find me on the Universal-Team discord server [here](https://universal-team.net/discord) or on the Strangetown discord server [here](https://discord.gg/dqfrTaerB6).

I'm not sure what else to say here, soo i keep it as this for now. Maybe i might update this later on, if i feel like. :)
