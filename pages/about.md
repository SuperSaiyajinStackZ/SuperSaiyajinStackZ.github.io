## About me
[![StackZ-Avatar-Image](/assets/images/stackz3.png){:.img-small}](/assets/images/stackz3.png)

Hey, it's me, StackZ or also known as SuperSaiyajinStackZ. I'm the founder of the [Universal-Team](https://github.com/Universal-Team) and [Sim2Team](https://github.com/Sim2Team), that's it.

I work on 3DS, and sometimes NDS homebrew apps, because it is fun to do so in C++. You can find me on the Universal-Team discord server [here](https://universal-team.net/discord) or on the Sim2Team discord server [here](https://sim2team.github.io/wiki/server).

I also focus quite a bit on researching the Savefiles about **The Sims 2: Game Boy Advance** and **The Sims 2: Nintendo DS**.

I'm not sure what else to say here, soo i keep it as this for now. Maybe i might update this later on, if i feel like. :)
