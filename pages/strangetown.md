**NOTE: This page is just a basic concept for now, it might change to something better in the future.**

Welcome to the Strangetown main page!

You are a fan of `The Sims 2` for the Game Boy Advance or Nintendo DS? Then you are right here!

I decided to create a discord server called `Strangetown`, you know.. the town where both game plays (if you played them before of course). I thought, why not start to create a community for the games, as both of the games are really underrated.

You are not sure about what games is being talked about? Then here are the covers from both games!
