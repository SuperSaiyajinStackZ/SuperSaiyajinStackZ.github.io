**There aren't any blogs available yet.**

I may eventually write blogs about my savefile research and such about the following games in the future:

- `The Sims Bustin' Out (Game Boy Advance)`
- `The Urbz - Sims in the City (Game Boy Advance)`
- `The Urbz - Sims in the City (Nintendo DS)`
- `The Sims 2 (Game Boy Advance)`
- `The Sims 2 - Hachamecha Hotel Life (Nintendo DS)`

^ These games are my main focus.. but maybe also others, who knows. Maybe i will also do blogs about different things, i'm not sure about it yet, as i never have written any blogs so far.

***The first blog is planned sometime around the weekend, if i get into it.***
